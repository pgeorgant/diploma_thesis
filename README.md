# "K-SVD for Sparse Representations"

This is the Matlab code for my [diploma thesis](https://nemertes.library.upatras.gr/server/api/core/bitstreams/f6a1a856-6e65-4da3-9dba-72643582ec3d/content) I implemented in 2018.

All code was written from scratch following the theory in 

Aharon, Michal, Michael Elad, and Alfred Bruckstein. "K-SVD: An algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation." IEEE Transactions on signal processing 54.11 (2006): 4311-4322.
